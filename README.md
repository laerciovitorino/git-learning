This repository will keep track of all my work during the How to Use Git and 
Github course at Udacity.com

Observation-1: The asteroids repository inside in this git-learning repository 
is not my own work. I've cloned this project from the Udacity website URL in 
order to do the exercises and quizzes required in the Git and Github course.

Observation-2: The pdf file entitled "troubleshooting_guide.pdf" was downloaded
from the Udacity website for a quick reference about git error messages. I just
added this file in here for a quick and better reference whenever I need it.
