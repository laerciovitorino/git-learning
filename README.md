This repository is aimed to keep track of all my work during the How to Use Git 
and Github course at Udacity website.

Disclaimer #1: The asteroids repository inside this git-learning repository is 
not my own work. I've cloned this project from the Udacity website using this
URL: https://github.com/udacity/asteroids.git I've done this in order to do the 
exercises and quizzes required in the Git and Github course. All the work was
done by Doug McInnes, Caroline Buckey and Sarah Spikes.

Disclaimer #2: The pdf file entitled "troubleshooting_guide.pdf" was downloaded
from the Udacity website for a quick reference about git error messages. I just
added this file here for sole purpose to use as a quick reference whenever I 
need it.
