    Q.: How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the 
    bug that was introduced?
    
    A.: The tool I used(i.e. diff on Linux terminal) pinpointed each difference 
    between the different versions of the file, showing me the changes that were 
    made to the original version of the file and let me fix those mistakes 
    easily.

    Q.: How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a 
    more efficient programmer in the long term?

    A.: I can compare what I did wrong in the past with what I'm doing now, and

    subject and then I can review my past works and then improve them with my 
    new skills.
