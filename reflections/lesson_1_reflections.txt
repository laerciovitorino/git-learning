    Q.: How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the 
    bug that was introduced?
    
    A.: The tool I used(i.e. diff on Linux terminal) pinpointed each difference 
    between the different versions of the file, showing me the changes that were 
    made to the original version of the file and let me fix those mistakes 
    easily.

    Q.: How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a 
    more efficient programmer in the long term?

    A.: I can compare what I did wrong in the past with what I'm doing now, and 
    learn with my mistakes over time. Also, I can improve myself in a certain
    subject and then I can review my past works and then improve them with my 
    new skills.

    Q.: What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to 
    create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, 
    like Google docs does?

    A.: Pros:
        > I can have more control in what moment I should save my progress;
        > Sometimes it's much easier to keep track of which version of the
          file I'm working on;
        > It's easy to fix a mistake by reverting a file to a specific version
          of it.
        
        Cons:
        > It can be hard sometimes to decide when is a good moment to save a
          version of the file;
        > There is a possibility to forget to commit and then loose a lot of
          changes made in some version of the file.
       

    Q.: Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving 
    multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each 
    file separately?
