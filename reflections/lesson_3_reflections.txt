    Q.: When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all 
        your work local?
    
    A.: It's always a good idea to have a remote repository when you want share 
        all your work with other people, or when you want other people 
        collaborate with you in some task or project, or even when you want your
        work accessible wherever you go to work whenever you can.
    
    Q.: Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having
        Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
    
    A.: Because is not always you want all the code/files that are in the remote
        at a certain time. So it is preferable that the user has the control
        over which files are necessary and relevant in each circumstances.
    
    Q.: Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When
        would you use one instead of another?
    
    A.: Forks are like clones but work that way only on Github context. Clone is
        the process of pulling a repository from a remote location(e.g. a server
        to your local machine, or to 'copy' one repository into another one in 
        your local machine. Branches are labels created to commits and are like
        clones but only work that way in the local machine.
        Fork is used to clone a project in the Github environment.
        Clone is used to pulling down remote repositories into your local
        machine or to copy one repository into another one in your local
        machine.
        Branches is used to label commits for a specific purpose, for example
        to create and test new feature in a project.
