    Q.: When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
    
    A.: It's always a good idea to have a remote repository when you want share all your work with other people, or when you want
        other people collaborate with you in some task or project, or even when you want your work accessible wherever you go to
        work whenever you can.
