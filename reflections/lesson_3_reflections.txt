    Q.: When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all 
        your work local?
    
    A.: It's always a good idea to have a remote repository when you want share 
        all your work with other people, or when you want other people 
        collaborate with you in some task or project, or even when you want your
        work accessible wherever you go to work whenever you can.
    
    Q.: Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having
        Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
    
    A.: Because is not always you want all the code/files that are in the remote
        at a certain time. So it is preferable that the user has the control
        over which files are necessary and relevant in each circumstances.
