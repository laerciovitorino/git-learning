    Q.: What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do 
        it?
    
    A.: A .git folder is created, which is responsible to keep track of all the
        work that will be done in that respository. The repository now is a git
        one.
        It's necessary to initialize the repository to turn it into a git
        repository, and then start to keep track of all the work done in that
        directory and keep that folder under version control.
