    Q.: What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do 
        it?
    
    A.: A .git folder is created, which is responsible to keep track of all the
        work that will be done in that respository. The repository now is a git
        one.
        It's necessary to initialize the repository to turn it into a git
        repository, and then start to keep track of all the work done in that
        directory and keep that folder under version control.
    
    Q.: How is the staging area different from the working directory and the
        repository? What value do you think it offers?
    
    A.: The staging area is a part of Git that permits the user to decide if
        those files inserted therein will be in the next commit or not. It is
        an intermediate area where the files stay before going to the 
        repository or be removed. So I think the staging area offers a great
        flexibility to the user in order to facilitate his/her work on files
        under version control.
